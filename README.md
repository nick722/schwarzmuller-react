138 MENU Component
==============

Maybe create a hamburger icon

make it clickable
somehow get to Layout Component
and adjust the State to set showSideDrawer to true
make sure that you can click something in the toolbar
set the State as said earlier
and that will change the 'open' property of the SideDrawer
